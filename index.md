I am a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia and **[ARC Training Centre in Data Analytics for Resources and Environment (DARE)](https://darecentre.org.au/portfolio_page/arpit-kapoor/)** currently supervised by **[Dr Rohitash Chandra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/rohitash-chandra)**, **[Dr Sahani Pathiraja](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/sahani-pathiraja)** and **[Professor Lucy Marshall](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/structure-governance/executive/executive-dean-faculty-of-science-and-engineering)**. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Quince](https://www.onequince.com/), an online retail start-up based in the United States. 

I hold 4 years of experience in research and development of data-intensive AI/ML applications overcoming complex architectural and scalability issues in diverse industries. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. During this period, I actively took part in **[humanoid robotics research](https://www.srmth.in/)** at the University and presented research articles in the area of humanoid control.

My interest lies in modelling uncertainity in decision making through Bayesian Machine Learning for practical applications in Environment science, Robotics, and Computer Vision etc.
