I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, affiliated with the **[ARC Training Centre in Data Analytics for Resources and Environment (DARE)](https://darecentre.org.au/)** . I am supervised by Dr Rohitash Chandra, Dr Sahani Pathiraja, and Professor Lucy Marshall.

My research focuses on the synergy of process-based hydrological models with machine learning to advance environmental process modelling. I have developed hybrid and Bayesian deep learning approaches for rainfallâ€“runoff modelling, flood forecasting, cyclone prediction, and groundwater flow emulation, with publications in Environmental Modelling & Software and Journal of Hydrology (under review). I also work on uncertainty quantification and reproducibility in scientific machine learning, and have presented my work at forums.

Alongside my PhD, I worked as a Climate Science Support Officer at the Bureau of Meteorology, where I implemented multivariate bias correction (MRNBC) for climate projections, modernised legacy workflows, and co-authored an abstract for EGU 2025. Previously, I held roles as a Data Scientist (Quince, 3Qi Labs) and Machine Learning Engineer (BoMoTix), where I designed and deployed scalable ML systems across domains.

I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019, during which I led **[humanoid robotics research](https://www.srmth.in/)** and presented work at IEEE conferences. My broad research interests lie in Bayesian machine learning, operator learning, and hybrid modelling approaches, with a focus on building interpretable, reproducible, and impactful tools for environmental and scientific applications.
