I previously worked as a Deep Learning Engineer at Bomotix (Body Motion Analytics), a startup company based in Hyderabad, India. There, I was responsible for developing end-to-end Deep Learning pipelines for Computer Vision workflows involving applications like Object Detection/Tracking and Human Pose Estimation.

I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. During this period, I actively took part in the Humanoid robotics research at the University and presented research articles in the area of humanoid control. I also actively worked on several research projects in Bayesian Machine Learning including areas like bayesian transfer learning and parallel tempering for bayesian neural networks.
