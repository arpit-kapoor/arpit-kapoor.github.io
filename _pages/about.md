I am a budding Data Scientist currently working at [3Qi Labs Pvt Ltd](http://3qilabs.com/) where I build scalable data-driven solutions for data quality assurance using machine learning. I strongly believe that AI and machine learning will play a key role in the future of Data-driven technologies. Although there have been significant advances in this area, much work still remains in making these applications more robust and sustainable. 

Deep Learning, Computer vision, Robotics and Big Data Quality and integrity maintenance are few of the areas that I have worked with. 

Bayesian Neural Learning is one of my areas of interest. Hence, in my past work with Dr Rohitash Chandra, who is a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Australia, focus on developing methodologies to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with Neural Networks. In our ongoing project, we are working on incorporating heuristic nature of Evolutionary algorithms to optimize Bayesian sampling schemes for Deep Neural Networks.
