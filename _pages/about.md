I am a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia and **[ARC Training Centre in Data Analytics for Resources and Environment (DARE)](https://darecentre.org.au/portfolio_page/arpit-kapoor/)** currently supervised by **[Dr Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra)** and **[Professor Lucy Marshall](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/lucy-marshall)**. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Quince](https://www.onequince.com/), an online retail start-up based in the United States. 

I hold 4 years of experience in research and development of data-intensive AI/ML applications overcoming complex architectural and scalability issues in diverse industries. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. During this period, I actively took part in **[humanoid robotics research](https://www.srmist.edu.in/students-gateway/about-us-humanoid)** at the University and presented research articles in the area of humanoid control.

<!-- I previously was a machine learning research intern at The University of Sydney where I worked on research projects in Bayesian Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof Sally Cripps and **[Dr Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra)**. I continue to remotely collaborate with Dr Chandra on various research projects.
