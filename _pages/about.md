I am a Junior Data Scientist at [3Qi Labs Pvt Ltd](http://3qilabs.com/), building data-driven solutions using machine learning. I strongly believe that AI and machine learning will play a key role in the future of Data-driven technologies. Although there have been significant advances in this area, data quality maintenance is still a non-trivial task that involves hours of manual work. Hence, my projects at 3Qi Labs involve creating scalable machine learning solutions to detect data quality issues in Big Data.

Bayesian Neural Learning is one of my areas of interest. Hence, in my past work with Dr Rohitash Chandra, who is a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Australia, I focus on developing methodologies to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with Neural Networks. In our ongoing project, we are working on incorporating heuristic nature of Evolutionary algorithms to optimize Bayesian sampling schemes for Deep Neural Networks.
