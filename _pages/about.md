I am a budding Data Scientist, looking to solve new challenges using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

After completing my Undergraduate degree with major in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019, I started working as a deep learning Engineer at a startup named, Bomotix Pvt ltd, where I was responsible for carrying out the research and development of various Computer vision based deep learning models for applications like Object Detection-Tracking and Human Pose Estimation. Moreover, I also deployed these models on GCP using Docker containers and Kubernetes.

I currently work as a Junior Data Scientist at [OoBA Labs](http://oobalabs.com/) where I build scalable data-driven solutions for data quality assurance using machine learning. I strongly believe that AI and machine learning will play a key role in the future of Data-driven technologies. Although there have been significant advances in this area, much work still remains in making these applications more robust and sustainable. 

My research interest lies in combining Bayesian Machine learning techniques with Deep Learning. Hence, my recent work with Dr Rohitash Chandra, who is a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Australia, focus on developing methodologies to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with Neural Networks. In our ongoing project, we are working on incorporating heuristic nature of Evolutionary algorithms to optimize Bayesian sampling schemes for Deep Neural Networks.
