I am an aspiring Data Scientist, currently working at [OoBA Labs](http://oobalabs.com/) where I work on research and development of machine learning models for an AI driven data quality solution platform.

I strongly believe that AI and machine learning will play a key role in the future of Data-driven technologies. Although there have been significant advances in this area, much work still remains in making these applications more robust and sustainable.

I received my Undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2019. After which I started working as a Deep Learning Engineer at a startup company, Bomotix; where I was responsible for developing end-to-end Deep Learning pipelines for Computer Vision workflows involving applications like Object Detection/Tracking and Human Pose Estimation.

My research interest also lies in combining Bayesian Machine learning techniques with Deep Learning. Hence, in my recent work with Dr Rohitash Chandra, who is a Senior Lecturer at the University of New South Wales, Australia, we focus on developing methodologies to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling with Neural Networks for various machine learning applications. In our ongoing project, we are working on incorporating heuristic nature of Evolutionary algorithms to optimize Bayesian sampling schemes for Deep Neural Networks using parallel processing on High Performance Computiong platforms.
